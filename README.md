## 🔍 Motivation
Most companies ask algorithmic questions during interviews. While I can solve problems with brute-force approaches, I’m focusing on **optimizing time/space complexity** through this journey. Here’s how I’m improving:
- Practicing 3 problems daily (1 Easy, 1 Medium, 1 Hard).
- Analyzing patterns (e.g., Two Pointers, Sliding Window).
- Revisiting weak areas (e.g., Dynamic Programming, Graphs).
